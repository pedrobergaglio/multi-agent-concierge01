"""
A multi-agent conversational system for navigating a complex task tree.
In this demo, the user is navigating a financial system.

Agent 1: look up a stock price.
Does not require authentication, has specialized tools for looking up stock prices.

Agent 2: authenticate the user.
A required step before the user can interact with some of the other agents.

Agent 3: look up an account balance.
Requires the user to be authenticated first.

Agent 4: transfer money between accounts.
Requires the user to be authenticated first, and have looked up their balance already.

Concierge agent: a catch-all agent that helps navigate between the other 4.

Orchestration agent: decides which agent to run based on the current state of the user.
